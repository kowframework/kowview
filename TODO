== FOR NOW the development is halted in favour of the kvdriver development; once kvdriver is usable I'll finish the required services ==

Things that should be done to the 3.0 release:

	* exception templates should use the KTML template now, instead of the AWS engine

	* determine which way for initializing he component variable is best: services or modules

	* template for menu module in kvdriver
	* security (password based)
		=> logout_service
		=> switch_user_service
		=> login_controller_module
		=> switch_user_controller_module

	* security (REST based)
		=> facebook specific code
		=> google specific code
		=> yahoo specific code
		=> then convert into an univorm API



The config path should be default to:
	1 => ./data/
	2 => ./components/




Adding the following comment:
-- TODO :: command line argument

So we can list every possible command line argument
